	* generic/trofs.c:	Different bug fix for 22.0; this one shouldn't
				have the troubles with infinite loops during

	* configure:		autoconf-2.57
	* library/trofs.tcl:	configure

	all code bits that stat and archive file to update that status.
	Also improved efficiency by storing the cached directory objects
	of the right objtype in the parent field.
	* configure.in:		Bump to 0.3.5

2004-05-07  Don Porter <donald.porter@nist.gov>

	archive file.  Caused binary files not to be fully copied into
	the archive.  Bump to 0.3.2.

	* configure.in:			Updated test suite to use the
	* tests/all.tcl:		tcltest package.  Made trofs.tcl
	* tests/load.tcl.in (new):	a generated file.  Bumped to
	* tests/trofs.test (new):	version 0.3.1.

	* configure.in:		Add crew.c to TEA_ADD_SOURCES.
	* configure:		autoconf-2.57

2004-05-04  Don Porter <donald.porter@nist.gov>

	* Makefile.in:	Reworked targets so that `make dist` packages up
	* configure.in:	pre-built documentation.  This way end users do
	not need mpexpand; only those developers hacking on the docs.

	* configure:	autoconf-2.57

2004-05-03  Don Porter <donald.porter@nist.gov>

	* generic/trofs.c:	Changed archive file format so that
	* library/trofs.tcl:	signature comes at the end.  It's now
	possible to append a trofs archive onto an existing trofs archive,
	though it's a dumb idea (access to the first archive is lost).
	Less seeking and less index data is required with the new format.
	Thanks to Joe English for the suggestion.  Also corrected use of
	utf-8 encoding when reading directory indices.
