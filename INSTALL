This package conforms to the conventions of the Tcl Extension Architecture,
version 3.6.  With suitable utilities, you can build, install, and use this
software via this sequence of commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The trofs (Tcl Read-only Filesystem) package is meant to be a
package used with Tcl 8.5 and later releases.  It should work
out of the box with the instructions above.  If necessary, you
can use the --with-tcl= option to configure to point out which
tclConfig.sh file describes your Tcl installation.

The trofs package comes with a test suite.  You can test the operations
of the package with the command:

    make test

This release of trofs can also work in a limited way with Tcl 8.4
releases at patchlevel 8.4.7 or later.  To use trofs with Tcl 8.4.x,
first you will need to install the "dict" package available at

    http://pascal.scheffers.net/software/

You will need release 8.5.1 (or later?) of "dict".  Build and install
it on top of your Tcl 8.4.x installation, accepting all defaults.

After the "dict" package is installed, you will be able to build and
install this trofs release.

The trofs package built and installed against Tcl 8.4 + dict 8.5.1
will have a few limitations.  There are known bugs in the [file link]
and [glob] commands in Tcl 8.4 (Tcl Bugs 833713 and 943995) that may
diminish the utility of trofs somewhat.  Also, the trofs package
built and installed against Tcl 8.4 + dict 8.5.1 will only successfully
load into a Tcl 8.4 interpreter with the dict package available.  Even
though "stubs" are used, the trofs package compiled against Tcl 8.4
will not be able to successfully [load] into a Tcl 8.5 interpreter.
When you upgrade to Tcl 8.5, you will need to recompile the trofs
package to use it.
